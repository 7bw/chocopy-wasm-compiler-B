# Conflict Evaluation

## 1. Bignums

## 2. Built-in libraries/Modules/FFI


## 3. Closures/first class/anonymous functions

## 4. comprehensions

In `repl.ts`, they appended the source code of buildin classes to the original source code,
and then replace the `source` with `sourceCode` which includes buildin classes.

Since their change will not affect the other part of source code, we can resolve the conflict
by using their modification. 

## 5. Destructuring assignment

## 6. Error reporting

## 7. Fancy calling conventions

## 8. for loops/iterators

## 9. Front-end user interface

## 10. Generics and polymorphism

## 11. I/O, files

Potential conflict may occur in extenstion part in `webpack.config.js`. We add `.js` to resolve
files with `.js` extenstion.

Since supporting more extension will not affect other feature implementation, we can resolve the
conflict by using our modification.

## 12. Inheritance

## 13. Lists

## 14. Memory management

## 15. Optimization

## 16. Sets and/or tuples and/or dictionaries

## 17. Strings
