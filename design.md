2.
Basic assignment and printing: 
“x: int = 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 
print(x)” 
Expected: “999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999” 
3.
Unary operation: 
“x: int = -999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 
print(x)” 
Expected: “-999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999”
4.
Basic addition: 
“x:int = 1000000000000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000000000000
print(x)” 
Expected: 2000000000000000000000000000
5.
Basic subtraction: 
“x:int = 5000000000000000000000000000 - 2000000000000000000000000000
print(x)” 
Expected: 3000000000000000000000000000
6.
Multiply i32s to get BigNum: 
“x:int = 10000*300000
print(x)” 
Expected: 3000000000
7.
Divide: 
“x:int = 30000000000000000000000000000 / 30000000000 
print(x)”
Expected: 1000000000000000000
8.
Comparison Operator: 
“x:int = 1000000000000000000
y: int = 2000000000000000000
If y > x: 
	print(True)
Else: 
	print(False)
Expected: True” 
9.
Equality Operator: 
“x:int = 1000000000000000000
y: int = 2000000000000000000
If y == x: 
	print(True)
Else: 
	print(False)
Expected: False” 
10.
List Test (for when it’s implemented): 
“x:int = 900000001
list1 = [3] * x
print(list1[x-1])”
Expected: 3
