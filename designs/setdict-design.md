# Set/Tuple/Dictionary: Project Milestone For Week 7
For now, we'd like to start with dictionary. The following design document will be based on dictionary, but may be subject to change later.

## Test Cases
// TODO
1. Initialize the dictionary in Chocopy. This can be done using a constructor like this:  
`dict_1 : [int, int] = None`  
`dict_1 = {}`

## Changes To AST/IR
// TODO

## New Functions/Datatypes
// TODO

## Value Representation & Memory Layout
// TODO
